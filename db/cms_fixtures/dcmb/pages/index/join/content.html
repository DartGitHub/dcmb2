The DCMB welcomes new members from any grade and at any time of
the year, and there are no auditions. You can even borrow an instrument if you don't have one,
and we'll get you set up with a uniform and music as fast as we
can. We'll have a number of events for freshmen during Orientation. If you're already here, just come to one of our [rehearsals](/schedule). If you have more
questions, you can contact our publicity chairs, [Allyson Long](mailto:Allyson.M.Long.17@dartmouth.edu) and [Autumn Brunelle](mailto:Autumn.M.Brunelle.15@dartmouth.edu). Either way, it's even easier
for us if you fill out the
following form to let us know you're interested.

The DCMB doesn't have an official Color Guard, but we've had an assortment of people with color guard and twirling experience who have performed with the band at games.
