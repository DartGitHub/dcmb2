In the fall, the band has practice every week on Wednesday from 4:30 to 5:00 PM, and Fridays from 5:00 to 8:00 PM (we usually won't use the full three hours). In the winter we only practice Wednesday afternoons, 4:00 to 6:00. Below is a schedule of the games at which we will be playing, as well as practices and other band events.

All our practices are held in Hartman. Don't know where Hartman
is? In the Hop, go down the stairs past Spaulding, and then turn around and go
down some more stairs, and then turn right and go down some more
stairs. Walk straight ahead and it's on the right. It's on the
level below the jewelry studio and woodshop.
