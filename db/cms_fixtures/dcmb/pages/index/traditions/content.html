Formed in the 1890's, the DCMB is the oldest band in the Ivy League. Originally it was a military band, but in the 1960's it became a scatter band, as described on our <a href="/">home page.</a> Over time we've accumulated many traditions. Some, like the kazoo section, have come and gone, but others are still going strong.
If you have information about old or current traditions, please blitz/email the <a href="mailto:DCMBWebmaster@dartmouth.edu">webmaster</a> and they'll be posted.

Shows

Here is a selection of some of our more recent shows, to give you a taste of what they sound like.

M Jokes
--------
At every half-time the band "takes the field" with the announcer's declaration of  
"An now, the only band in the Ivy League that [insert joke/funny description], the Dartmouth College M______ Band!"  
You can see some of our favorites at the top of the pages on this website.

Singing on Away Trips
---------------------
Each fall, when the band goes to either its New York or Boston away game, we go to the top of the highest building in the city and sing Dartmouth songs.
