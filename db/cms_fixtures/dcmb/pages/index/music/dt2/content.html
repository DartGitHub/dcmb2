Come Stand Up Men (DT2)
=======================

Come stand up men and sing for Dartmouth.  
Cheer when the team in green appears.  
For naught avails the strength of _Harvard_,  
When they hear our mighty cheers!  

Fight, fight, fight for Dartmouth,  
And tear on down the field.  
Touchdown, Touchdown, Dartmouth,  
For the old _Crimson_'s strength must yield.
