Son of a Gun for Beer
=====================

I wish I had a barrel of rum and sugar, three hundred pound  
I’d put it in the College bell and stir it ’round and ’round,  
Let ev’ry honest fellow drink his glass of hearty cheer,  
For I’m a student of old Dartmouth and a son of a gun for beer.  

(Chorus)  
I’m a son of a, son of a, son of a, son of a, son of a gun for beer.  
I’m a son of a, son of a, son of a, son of a, son of a gun for beer.  
Like ev’ry honest fellow I like my whiskey clear,  
For I’m a student of old Dartmouth and a son of a gun for beer.  

And if I had a daughter, sir, I’d dress her up in green;  
And put her on the campus to join the freshman team.  
And if I had a son, sir, I’ll tell you what he’d do.  
He'd yell “To Hell with Harvard” like his daddy used to do.  

(Chorus)
