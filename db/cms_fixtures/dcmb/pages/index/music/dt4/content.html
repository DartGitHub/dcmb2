Glory to Dartmouth (DT4)
========================

Glory to Dartmouth,  
Loyal, we sing.  
Now, all together,  
**MAKE THE ECHOES RING FOR DARTMOUTH!**  

Our team's a winner,  
We've got the stuff!  
We wear the Dartmouth Green  
And that's enough!  
**DARTMOUTH, DARTMOUTH, GO GREEN, GO!**
