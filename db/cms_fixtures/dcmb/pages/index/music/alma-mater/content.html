Dear Old Dartmouth (Alma Mater)
===============================

Dear old Dartmouth, give a rouse  
For the College on the hill,  
For the Lone Pine above her,  
And the loyal ones who love her.  
Give a rouse, give a rouse, with a will!  
For the sons of old Dartmouth,  
For the daughters of Dartmouth.  
Though 'round the girdled Earth they roam,  
Her spell on them remains.  
They have the still North in their hearts,  
The hill winds in their veins,  
And the granite of New Hampshire  
In their muscles and their brains.  
And the granite of New Hampshire  
In their muscles and their brains.  

Dear old Dartmouth, set a watch,  
Lest the old traditions fail.  
Stand as sister stands by brother.  
Dare a deed for the old mother.  
Greet the world from the hills with a hail!  
For the sons of old Dartmouth,  
For the daughters of Dartmouth.  
Around the world they keep for her  
Their old undying faith.  
They have the still North in their soul,  
The hill winds in their breath,  
And the granite of New Hampshire  
Is made part of them 'til death.  
And the granite of New Hampshire  
Is made part of them 'til death.
