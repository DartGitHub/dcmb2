The DCMB plays a wide variety of music, ranging from the
occasional march to popular songs to movie and video game
music and more. Some of our favorites include "Hey Baby", "Build me
up Buttercup", "The Muppets Theme", "Pirates of the Caribbean",
and "Time Warp".

In addition to these, in our weekly parade, while marching
on and off the field, and whenever the football team scores, we
play the school fight songs, aka "Dartmouth Tunes" (DT's).
