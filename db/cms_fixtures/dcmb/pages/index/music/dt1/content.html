Dartmouth's in Town Again (DT1)
===============================

Dartmouth's in town again,  
Team, Team, Team!  
Echo the old refrain,  
Team, Team, Team!  
Dartmouth, for you we sing.  
Dartmouth, the echoes ring.  
Dartmouth, we cheer for you!  
  
Down where the men in green,  
Play on play,  
Are fighting like Dartmouth men.  
We have a Dartmouth team and say,  
Dartmouth's in town again!
