As the Backs Go Tearing By (DT3)
================================

As the backs go tearing by,  
On their way to do or die,  
Many sighs and many tears,  
Mingle with the _Harvard_ cheers,  
As the backs go tearing by.  

Making gain on steady gain,  
Echo swells the sweet refrain.  
Dartmouth's going to win today!  
Dartmouth's sure to win today,  
As the backs go tearing by!
